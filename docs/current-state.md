## Current World V2 Delta (2026-07-30)

This section is the current implementation summary. The dated runtime inventory after it is a
historical snapshot, even where its original prose uses the present tense.

### Private Self, Selective Recall, and Expression

- A pinned World Context and source-bound Current Self provide the character with current
  conversation, life, affect, relationship, memory, capability, and consequence material.
- The character model first forms a turn-local `PrivateTurnState`. This is an auditable proposal
  about what she notices and thinks now; it is neither a new world fact nor authority to invent one.
- Inbound semantic prefetch may place a small, source-bound attention set in the first role-model
  call; it remains reference material, never a behavior decision. A valid, model-chosen
  `recall_request` can open one further bounded selective-recall pass. Every prefetch trace that a
  role call actually sees is recorded in call order with its phase and model-call identity; a
  prepared result that no role call saw is neither claim authority nor a delivered-memory metric.
- Proactive consideration only schedules prefetch beside its first role call and never waits for or
  injects that result. If the character chooses `recall_request`, the follow-up may absorb a result
  that is already ready at zero wait; otherwise the character pull proceeds without waiting on the
  automatic lane.
- The character then chooses `now`, `later`, or `silent`, and, when expressing, chooses the
  modalities, number of message beats, cadence, questions, self-disclosure, and wording. Local
  appraisal and durable Affect can inform Current Self, but they do not dictate the visible reply.

### Context-Driven Proactive Contact V3

- Source-bound life, activity, affect, relationship, Thread, Commitment, and related semantic
  changes are merged into a ten-minute stimulus window. A recorded draw chooses a consideration
  opportunity at 2, 15, or 45 minutes; additional events join the same window without redrawing it.
- When no new event exists, ambient opportunities remain available on a relationship- and
  situation-weighted cadence between 45 minutes and 8 hours. Night, busyness, and low closeness
  change opportunity weights, not permission to speak.
- These timers decide only when the character may reconsider. They cannot create a motive, prose,
  life fact, or send decision. At consideration time the model receives the pinned context, forms a
  free-text `impulse_summary`, and chooses `now`, `later`, or `silent`.
- `silent` closes only that consideration. Provider, parsing, or worker failures are technical
  failures and follow their retry path; they must not be recorded as character silence. New user
  ingress retires stale, unexecuted proactive cognition and establishes a fresh context.
- There is no forced maximum-silence send, fixed motive taxonomy, template greeting, or random
  `act/hold` gate. Authorized external Actions remain effect-once even when later conversation
  supersedes the cognition that proposed them.

### Retired Behavioral Authority

- `afterthought_author` and `open_thread_afterthought` have no production drain. Their historical
  events remain replayable, while same-turn continuations and multiple bubbles are ordinary
  `ExpressionDraft`/`ExpressionPlan` beats. A genuinely later impulse must come through the
  event-driven initiative path.
- Legacy message-category routing, question budgets, `emotional_ghost`, fixed follow-up lanes,
  mood-to-expression matrices, and broad naturalness sanitizers do not decide whether or how the
  World V2 character responds. A new user Observation ends stale, uncommitted pre-Action
  expression work without first classifying the user's message into a social-behavior category.
- Deterministic code still enforces source closure, privacy and consent, safety and law, external
  Action authorization, effect-once delivery, CAS, receipts, and replayability. Everything outside
  those hard boundaries remains a character-model decision. This is the project's meaning of
  controlled high variance.

## Historical Runtime Snapshot (2026-07-09)

The remainder of this document preserves the earlier daemon inventory and migration context. Read
its words such as “now”, “current”, and “implemented” as referring to that snapshot unless a
paragraph is explicitly labelled as a World V2 migration note.

### Core Runtime Decision

The Companion Daemon is now the canonical runtime for 沈知栀. It owns the character profile,
relationship state, long-term memory, self-core, prompt construction, postprocessing, proactive
scheduling, budget gates, and QQ delivery behavior.

SillyTavern is optional. It can still be used as a manual UI or prompt experiment surface, but it is
not the source of truth for the companion. The default `CONVERSATION_CORE` is `prompt`; setting it to
`sillytavern` explicitly enables the compatibility adapter.

### Companion Daemon

The Python daemon is implemented and tested.

Verified commands:

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run companion-sim --fake "我刚刚在忙，现在回来了"
uv run companion-sim "我刚刚在忙，现在回来了"
uv run companion-eval-dialogue --context
```

The real `companion-sim` command successfully used the local `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable and produced:

- a companion reply,
- an internal/private proactive thought,
- and sometimes a no-send proactive decision.

This confirms the core loop can call the DeepSeek API.

Debug endpoint:

```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8765/debug/geoff/context?preview_text=你在干嘛'
```

This returns the daemon-owned state, recent chat lines with local freshness tags, the selected
context package, selected memory lines, self-core text, and a preview prompt. The preview is for
inspection only and does not update state or send a message.

The historical reply context path had a deterministic regression suite. It verified that unrelated profile
facts are not padded into a reply, explicitly sidelined topics do not leak back through retrieval,
temporary schedules expire, conflicting location facts choose the newest version, and unresolved
emotion becomes a compact legacy reply policy rather than public-facing inner monologue. World V2
replaced that policy with sourced Current Self, model-owned private turn state, and selective recall.

Local dashboard:

```bash
WORLD_V2_DASHBOARD_OPERATOR_TOKEN=replace-with-the-shared-read-token uv run companion-daemon
# Start the QQ owner process with the same token in its environment.
open http://127.0.0.1:8765/dashboard
```

The page is an authenticated, read-only World v2 owner view. The browser reads one typed snapshot
through the daemon; the QQ process owns the ledger and compiles the snapshot. The page cannot tune
mood or relationship values, edit memories, tick the scheduler, dispatch a proactive action, read
`/health`, or fall back to an archived runtime. `DELIVERY_RECONCILIATION_TOKEN` is intentionally not
accepted as the Dashboard credential.

### HTTP Daemon

Verified:

```bash
uv run companion-daemon
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/health
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/messages \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"platform":"qq","platform_user_id":"geoff","text":"我在 QQ 上试一下，你在吗"}'
```

The daemon returned a real generated reply.

### Optional SillyTavern

SillyTavern is checked out at:

```text
external/SillyTavern
```

Verified:

```bash
cd external/SillyTavern
npm install
npm run start
```

It starts at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Installed extensions, kept as reference/sandbox tooling:

- Smart-Memory
- SillyTavern-EchoText
- SillyTavern-EchoText-Proactive server plugin

The server plugin loaded successfully:

```text
[EchoText-Proactive] Plugin loaded. Version: 1.0.0
[EchoText-Proactive] Scheduler started (tick every 60s).
```

SillyTavern logs an AI Horde certificate error on startup. This appears to be from its built-in external AI Horde status check and does not block local startup or the DeepSeek route.

### QQ Official WebSocket

Webhook setup was blocked by QQ's domain filing/备案 requirement for callback URLs. The project switched to QQ official WebSocket using `qq-botpy`.

Verified command:

```bash
uv run companion-qq-ws --sandbox
```

Verified behavior:

- Access token acquisition succeeds.
- WebSocket gateway connects.
- The gateway reports robot startup success.
- Robot name is `沈知栀 Celia Shen`.
- QQ private C2C messages reach the local process.
- The companion replies in QQ private chat.
- Rapid messages from the same QQ user are handled by a turn-taking state machine before one reply.
- The turn-taking policy waits longer for likely unfinished fragments and replies sooner for complete questions or explicit "you can answer now" cues.
- Local sticker/image sending through QQ official rich-media APIs works in sandbox.
- Ordinary QQ replies can attach a mood-appropriate local sticker after the text reply.
- Explicit image/selfie requests can generate and attach an OpenAI image when `ALLOW_AUTO_IMAGE_GENERATION=true`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured, the character boundary check allows it, and the local budget gate allows it.
- Early, pushy, or emotionally badly timed selfie requests are deferred/refused in prompt context instead of generating an image.
- Proactive decisions can rarely attach a self-initiated life image/selfie when relationship state, mood, image generator configuration, and budget allow it.
- The first沈知栀 visual reference set is saved under `assets/reference/`; LoRA/FaceID training has not been done yet.
- A human-rhythm layer injects Chengdu local day phase, private activity, attention mode, and no-stage-direction guidance into chat/proactive prompts.
- Sending a reply or proactive message now feeds back into mood state by reducing unresolved charge/initiative instead of leaving the state untouched.

Verified command:

```bash
uv run companion-send-sticker --user geoff --category happy --sandbox
```

Result:

```text
sent sticker: happy -> assets/stickers/rin-happy.png
sent sticker: teasing -> assets/stickers/rin-teasing.png
```

Implementation path:

```text
local PNG -> base64 file_data -> /v2/users/{openid}/files -> file_info -> msg_type=7 media message
```

### Multimodal

Implemented:

- QQ attachment normalization for images, audio, video, and files.
- Attachment metadata preservation through QQ message coalescing.
- Attachment metadata and summaries are injected into the companion prompt.
- Long-term memory records that the user sent image/audio/file attachments.
- Text-like file analysis hook.
- Provider-agnostic `MultimodalAnalyzer` interface.
- OpenAI-compatible image understanding and speech transcription provider.
- Local CNY budget gate for vision, transcription, and image generation.
- OpenAI vision summaries now classify image type, including stickers/memes, screenshots, photos,
  selfies, objects, and scenery, then inject a short visible-content summary into the prompt.
- If the user explicitly says an image is them or a selfie, the daemon stores a weak
  `user_visual_anchor` memory. It is treated as a hint only; the model is told not to identify a
  person from an image unless the user provides that context.

Current limits:

- DeepSeek's commonly documented API path is text-oriented, so true image understanding and voice transcription are intentionally provider-pluggable rather than hardcoded.
- OpenAI multimodal calls require `OPENAI_API_KEY` and can be disabled with `MULTIMODAL_PROVIDER=metadata`.
- Usage records are local estimates for throttling, not official billing data.
- Face identity is not implemented as biometric recognition. The current strategy is consent-based
  visual anchoring plus cautious prompt context, so it can remember what the user told it without
  pretending it can reliably recognize people.

### Character Profile

The character was reset from a premature girlfriend preset to a richer "just met" college student persona.

Current profile:

- Chinese name: 沈知栀
- English name: Celia Shen
- Age: 20
- Hometown: 嘉兴
- Current city: 上海
- School: 华东师范大学
- Major: 汉语言文学
- Relationship stage: 刚认识
- Origin: met through a QQ reading/city-walk interest group after the user shared a late-night Chengdu street note.

At the time of this snapshot, the prompt explicitly forbade stage directions such as `（手机震了一下）`,
action narration, and hidden psychological notes in public QQ/WeChat replies, and a sanitizer
removed common roleplay-style stage directions before sending. That sanitizer is historical
behavioral machinery, not World V2 expression authority.

World V2 migration note: the production QQ prompt does not impose a question quota, phrase blacklist,
reply-mode menu, or engagement objective. It supplies a source-bound Current Self and
requires the role model to form a turn-local `PrivateTurnState` before freely choosing
silence, questions, self-disclosure, timing, modality, wording, and message count. Factual
claims and externally checkable background details remain subject to source closure.

### Legacy Emotional and Reply State Machine

Historical implementation included:

- Interaction event classification for rude/control/warmth/apology/vulnerable/busy/returning/question/attachment-only messages.
- Expanded mood state: patience, security, curiosity, initiative, emotional charge, and boundary level.
- EchoText-inspired Plutchik emotion vector with baseline, affinity drift, natural decay, opposite-emotion suppression, and text intensity multipliers.
- EchoText-inspired MBTI/personality baseline anchors are applied from the character profile on first initialization only.
- Interaction events are persisted in SQLite.
- State is injected into both normal replies and proactive decisions.
- Existing mood state is no longer reset when the runtime builds a new engine.
- Boundary, hurt, anger, and disgust states reduce proactive frequency and life-event probability.
- EchoText-inspired proactive trigger timeline chooses concrete outreach reasons such as hanging question, late night, repair attempt, longing, random thought, inside joke, or soft follow-up.
- Trigger history, semantic category cooldowns, daily-stable jitter, and a max-unanswered-proactive guard reduce repetitive or needy proactive messages.
- Recent emotion impact can create a `mood_follow_up` proactive candidate when the state shift is strong enough.
- EchoText-inspired memory highlight detection extracts life facts, favorites, hobbies, important people, recent events, and shared moments.
- Context orchestration now builds a per-turn context package before model calls: current user
  intent, reply focus, forbidden stale-topic mistakes, relevant long-term memories, current life
  state, emotion/relationship impact, and a final prompt summary.
- Memory injection is selected through the context orchestrator instead of blindly injecting recent
  memories; runtime impulses are excluded and topic-overlapping memories are preferred.
- Near-duplicate memory entries are merged instead of stored as separate facts.
- EchoText-inspired image request detection recognizes direct selfie/image requests and affirmative responses to recent image offers.
- EchoText-inspired image prompt building classifies character/object/creative image requests and carries visual identity/context into stable generation prompts.
- Automatic image generation is guarded by character boundary checks and the local CNY budget gate, recording blocked/deferred requests instead of silently spending.
- Self-initiated proactive image sharing is supported as a rare state-machine outcome, separate from user-demanded selfies.
- EchoText-inspired reaction selection suggests lightweight reactions from emotional deltas; on the NapCat/OneBot channel these become real QQ emoji reactions (`set_msg_emoji_like`) applied to the user's message before she starts typing the reply.
- EchoText-inspired reply timing model estimates read/reply/ghost delays from emotion vectors. High volatility can trigger a true read-but-not-reply gap (`emotional_ghost` persisted as `reply_later` with `mark_unread=False`); short pre-reply pauses still come from `ghost_delay_ms` in the human timing layer.
- EchoText-inspired image style detection carries user-requested styles into generation prompts.
- The experimental external-context emotion bleed module has been removed: it never had a real event source in the QQ main path. If an external SillyTavern/MCP context source is added later, it should be reimplemented behind an explicit event adapter with end-to-end tests.
- Chengdu-local human rhythm context keeps replies from feeling like an always-on assistant and explicitly suppresses bracketed stage directions.
- QQ WebSocket delivery now adds read/think/typing delay before the first reply and human-sized pauses between split reply parts, instead of sending 2-3 parts in one burst.
- After QQ sends a normal reply, it may schedule several short human-like follow-up opportunities:
  a quick continuation, a delayed topic drift, and a soft reaction to silence. Any new user message
  cancels the pending follow-ups so she does not talk over the user.
- If the user speaks during the gap between split reply parts, QQ delivery now classifies the
  insertion. Backchannels such as "嗯嗯/对/哈哈" are recorded without interrupting; new questions,
  corrections, emotional messages, or substantive inserted text stop the remaining parts and start a
  new turn.
- Sticker selection maps newer moods such as `hurt`, `guarded`, `curious`, and `affectionate` to available visual assets.
- Tool/computer-operation requests are detected and logged as proposals. Risky actions are injected into the prompt as requiring explicit user confirmation; no MCP/computer action executes automatically yet.

World V2 migration notes:

- The fixed post-reply `open_thread_afterthought` lane is retired. Same-turn continuation is part
  of the character model's ordinary expression plan; a genuinely later impulse must arise through
  the event-driven initiative path. Historical events remain replayable.
- The legacy conversation engine still contains a conservative reply-decision experiment, but it
  is not part of the production World V2 QQ path. World V2 does not classify acknowledgements,
  questions, emotional messages, or long stories into host-chosen reply behavior.
- Production World V2 forms a sourced Current Self, offers one optional model-chosen Recall pass,
  and requires a `PrivateTurnState` before the character model freely chooses silence, questions,
  self-disclosure, timing, modality, wording, and message count.
- New user ingress invalidates stale uncommitted expression cognition directly. It does not use the
  legacy backchannel-versus-substantive classifier to decide whether the character may be
  interrupted; already-authorized external Actions retain their effect-once semantics.

See `docs/state-machine.md`.

## Historical Project Modules (2026-07-09)

This shallow module list records the pre-World-V2 layout. Current domain code lives primarily under
`src/companion_daemon/world_v2/`; do not infer current ownership boundaries from this inventory.

## Historical Character Configuration Note

The current companion profile lives at:

```text
configs/character.yaml
```

Current name:

```text
沈知栀 / Celia Shen
```

The profile is now loaded by the daemon instead of being hardcoded.

## Historical QQ Official Bot Status

Implemented locally:

- WebSocket adapter command: `uv run companion-qq-ws --sandbox`.
- `/qq/webhook` FastAPI endpoint.
- QQ callback validation response signing.
- QQ callback signature verification helper.
- C2C and group-at event parsing into daemon messages.
- Tests for official validation-signature sample from QQ docs.
- QQ official access-token client.
- QQ official C2C text sending client.
- QQ official group text sending client.

Verified:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Historical local verification count:

```text
81 tests passed
ruff check passed
```

Still not possible without user-side setup:

- Webhook callback without a filed/备案 domain.
- Production use outside the current sandbox/allowlist.
- Confirm whether official C2C proactive-message limits are acceptable.

The official send-message docs currently state that QQ single-chat proactive messages are heavily limited, while passive replies have a time window and per-message reply limits. This is why the first real QQ test must confirm whether the official single-chat product behavior is compatible with the companion experience.

## Important Security Note

Earlier terminal output exposed API keys in the local conversation. Treat those keys as compromised and rotate them.

## Historical Next-Step Note

At the time of the snapshot, the next proposed step was improving the QQ private-chat experience:

1. Keep this command running:

```bash
uv run companion-qq-ws --sandbox
```

2. Chat with 沈知栀 in QQ private chat.
3. Observe whether reply style, speed, and memory feel right.
4. Next implementation targets:

```text
- better QQ reply error logging
- true vision provider integration
- true speech-to-text provider integration
```

Implemented after this note:

```text
- turn-taking state machine for rapid multi-message bursts
- controlled proactive decision CLI:
  uv run companion-proactive --user geoff --sandbox
  uv run companion-proactive --user geoff --sandbox --send
- QQ sticker/image sending:
  uv run companion-send-sticker --user geoff --category happy --sandbox
- ordinary reply sticker/image delivery through QQ WebSocket
- guarded tool request proposal logging for future MCP integration
```
