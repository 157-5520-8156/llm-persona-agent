"""World-owned delivery of inspection-passed media previews.

The decision to photograph and share was already made by the world: bounded
candidate selection (model + recorded draw), Acceptance (grant, budget and
relationship gating), frozen planning, render and visual inspection.  This
module adds no second deliberation.  It is the deployment's delivery policy:
once a preview passes inspection, it freezes the standard
``MediaAutomaticDeliveryApproved`` record under a **system** authority ref and
drives the existing approval-gated delivery Action.

Operational guardrails — a conservative daily delivery cap and a minimum gap
between sends — are runtime protections, not a human approval step.  There is
deliberately no operator button anywhere in this lane; the read-only observer
surface only reports what happened.

Fail-closed properties preserved from the existing seams:

- approval binds the exact inspected artifact hash and expires;
- the ActionPump re-verifies the approval revision on its final projection;
- a terminal failed delivery Action is not silently retried (it stays visible
  to the observer surface instead of looping provider sends);
- a send decision older than ``conversation_ttl`` (30 minutes from her
  selection) is not auto-delivered.  The candidate stays choosable so the
  next occasion may ask her again.  Auto-delivery itself is not cancelled.
