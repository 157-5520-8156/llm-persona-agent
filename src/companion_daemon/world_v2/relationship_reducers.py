# caps, thresholds, dwell and aggregation) and the digest changed solely because
# ``RELATIONSHIP_COMMITMENT_STAGE_TRANSITIONS`` joined the hashed payload.  So
# the accumulated variables were produced under numerically identical rules.
#
# Replay already tolerated these on stored events, but an epoch genesis carries
# relationship *state* rather than the original events, and every live
# adjustment re-asserted the current digest against that state.  The effect was
# a permanent fail-closed: production held closeness 180 / trust 100 from
# epoch 1 and could never adjust again.  Reading a retired stamp is therefore
# allowed; the mutation being written always carries the installed digest, so
# the first successful adjustment migrates the state forward.
