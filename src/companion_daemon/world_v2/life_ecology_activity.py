"""Pure, source-bound activity openings for the first Life Ecology vertical.

The catalog is deliberately a read-only deep module.  A caller supplies one
already-pinned ledger projection and an immutable ``ClockAdvanced`` reference;
the module validates that authority, computes every legal successor for the
companion-owned abstract plans, and returns only opaque, deterministic tokens.
It cannot claim a trigger, call a model, or append an event.

Catalog-era location and registered-NPC plans still need the historical
availability snapshot.  Open-life plans already bound a location capability
when the world author accepted them; a bare location_ref remains blocked.
