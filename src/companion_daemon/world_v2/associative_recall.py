"""Replay-stable lexical prefetch over already source-bound Context candidates.

This is the first, deliberately narrow Recall Index adapter.  It never reads
the ledger, invents semantic labels, or recommends behavior.  Its input has
already passed cursor, privacy, supersession, and source-proof checks; it only
selects a small evidence set whose surface form is reactivated by the current
message.  Dense, temporal-query, and structured-link adapters can later replace
or join it behind the same compiler seam.
