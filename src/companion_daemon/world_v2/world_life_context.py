"""Read-only, source-bound life context for a companion's lived world.

``WorldOccurrenceProjection`` is ledger authority, but it is intentionally not
model input on its own.  This module is the narrow read seam between the two:
it selects settled occurrences that can be attributed to the companion and,
when an exact Life Development proposal reader is installed, exposes the
established premise of an active occurrence or the accepted intention of a
started/resumed activity. Candidate outcomes stay hidden until settlement;
an intention never proves its embedded backstory. This module never writes or
advances life state.
