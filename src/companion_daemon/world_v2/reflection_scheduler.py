"""Deterministic reflection scheduling for significant life appraisals.

The role model already owns appraisal, affect, and aspiration formation in
``world_stimulus``.  This scheduler is the algorithm side of the reflection
root cause: it decides *which* committed appraisals are significant enough to
be revisited, and opens one bounded reflection trigger per appraisal so the
character can deepen, let go, or form a wish about it later.  It never chooses
the reflection's content — that stays with the character.
