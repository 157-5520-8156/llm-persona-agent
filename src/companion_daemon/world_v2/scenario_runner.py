"""Offline executable evidence for the frozen World v2 scenario corpus.

This runner is deliberately narrower than the human-likeness evaluator.  It
uses a fixed fake chat model and a deterministic fake provider, invokes only
``WorldV2TurnApplication`` for ingress/delivery, then exports replay evidence.
It can prove that the 120 frozen fixtures exercise the v2 authority chain; it
cannot prove a real model or a person finds the output human-like.

    """A frozen scenario did not exercise its declared authority predicates."""


# This identifies the executable mechanism baseline independently from the
# frozen input corpus. ``.4`` supersedes a stale ``.3`` manifest after a
# clean-worktree rerun exposed that the hash recorded for ``.3`` did not match
# the executable 120-case suite.  The clean manifest was compared before and
# after the event-ecology composition change: every exported run field is
# identical, so this is a correction of the invalid fixture identity, not a
# claim that event ecology changed frozen observable behaviour.  ``.3`` had
# superseded a stale ``.2`` manifest after the
# enforcement-grade read-only-tool authorization binding was added to
# ``Action``.  Even ordinary Actions now carry the explicit, non-authorizing
# ``read_only_tool_authorization: null`` member in their canonical ledger
# payload.  That deliberately changes acceptance/event/replay identities,
# while the frozen suite proves that its observable scenario behaviour did not
# change.  It is not human-likeness evidence.
# ``.7`` establishes the post-refactor executable baseline after the shared
# expression draft, same-turn affect/fact composition, compact model-facing
# capsule, and proactive/life runtime were connected to the public application
# seam.  Every scenario predicate must still pass; the hash records the changed
# audit/action identities and background work trace, not a human-likeness score.
# ``.8`` records the intentional single-call cognition, affect-expression,
# epistemic claim, and durable two-Fact continuity contracts.  These alter
# proposal/context identities while all fixed scenario predicates remain the
# same executable gate.
# ``.9`` records the ``activity-opening.4`` catalog: ordinary activity
# completion now tracks the accepted schedule window instead of a one-minute
# elapsed floor, so a sixty-minute plan no longer "completes" after one wake.
# Catalog version and opening-token identities change accordingly; committed
# ``activity-opening.3`` and ``.2`` proposals still replay against their
# exact frozen rules and every fixed scenario predicate remains the gate.
# The recorded manifest is the complete fixed fake-suite hash produced by the
# executable corpus; keeping the version while correcting the stale digest is
# intentional and does not claim human-likeness evidence.
# ``.10`` re-baselines after the inner-life coverage verticals landed: the
# Change Phase advisory (and life-author-weight.5's phase prior), the per-NPC
# relationship reading (npc-initiative-weight.2), the pending shared_private
# invitation advisory, the private-impression background producer, and the
# aspiration crystallization seam.  Capsule advisory content and versioned
# weight identities legitimately shift the fixed-suite manifest; every fixed
# scenario predicate still passes unchanged.
# ``.12`` re-baselines the interactive-turn first-valid coordinator.  Fixed
# scenario proposals and predicates are unchanged, but their ModelResult
# audits now carry the explicit primary slot/winner outcome under
# ``model-result-audit.3`` and therefore have new deterministic identities.
# ``.13`` records deterministic semantic continuity selection.  Verified
# current/pending dialogue receives a bounded working-memory floor, related
# older dialogue and source-bound Fact/Memory/Thread text can be reactivated,
# and every retained item remains pinned to its original ledger authority.
# This intentionally changes Context Capsule and downstream proposal/audit
# identities; the fixed scenario predicates remain the executable gate.
# ``.14`` binds pending-interaction acknowledgement to the exact source
# Observation rather than reply delivery time.  Accepted reply authority now
# contributes that causal claim to recent dialogue, so multi-turn Context and
# downstream audit identities legitimately shift while predicates stay fixed.
# ``.15`` records the first source-bound associative-recall policy identity in
# the Context rank digest.  The narrow lexical prefetch can change which
# already-authoritative Fact/Memory/Thread evidence receives the bounded
# working-context floor; it does not change scenario predicates or grant new
# fact/action authority.
# ``.16`` records the completed character-owned recall contract.  Context now
# prepares bounded local attention candidates in parallel, model-visible
# prefetch/pull results carry exact query/source/cursor provenance under
# ``model-result-audit.4``, and paired cognition uses a one-hop transition
# proof.  This intentionally changes audit identities while every fixed
# scenario predicate remains the executable gate; it is not evidence that
# long-term conversational naturalness has already been established.
# ``.18`` adds source-complete private reflection lineage and explicit
# semantic-embedding degradation/cost state without changing scenario
# behavior.
# ``.17`` completes the dual-channel contract: a local prefetch that wins the
# non-blocking race is actually visible in the first cognition pass, uses the
# same Capsule item shape as other source-bound material, and is audited.
# Role-authored private reflection and the credential-gated semantic default
# also change model/capsule identities without changing scenario predicates.
# ``.19`` makes automatic recall actually reach the first cognition pass.  The
# 30-turn recall eval exposed four independent losses: the zero-wait prefetch
# race, successful injections evicting ranked capsule items, in-window
# dialogue echoes crowding out facts, and the global capsule cap repeatedly
# collapsing the fact lane to its deep-eviction floor. The first pass now
# joins once within a small fixed bound, injection supplements current
# dialogue, the corpus excludes the exact provider-visible working window,
# and the verified internal capsule has room for several independently
# sourced facts. Capsule and audit identities legitimately shift; every fixed
# scenario predicate remains the executable gate.
# ``.20`` tightens the model-facing source contract so first-person biography,
# relatives, past experiences, and enduring preferences are explicitly
# included in the existing source-closure boundary. It also makes a missing
# response-expectation assessment non-fatal to an otherwise valid reply; the
# unresolved expectation retains its existing expiry instead of being
# semantically settled by local code.
# ``.21`` keeps the independent expression episode available as an explicit
# experiment but disables its shadow call by default after real-provider
# testing showed queue inflation without a user-visible effect. The expression
# truth contract also states that unlisted people and past occurrences cannot
# be invented merely as conversational analogies.
# ``.22`` adds source-closed correction/withdrawal history and the durable
# hybrid recall seam.  The frozen scenarios do not change their outcomes, but
# their pinned capsule and reducer identities now include those new authority
# fields.
# ``.25`` installs reducer bundle .41 for the source-bound
# ExperienceMemoryDecisionRecorded audit. The event is deliberation-only and
# changes no fixed scenario predicate, but the installed reducer identity is
# intentionally part of every scenario manifest.
# ``.28`` records contextual short-utterance recall attention.  The automatic
# query now includes the recent verified dialogue and withholds an isolated
# sub-three-character lexical cue, preventing e.g. “来了” from outranking the
# current topic merely because an old message contained “回来了”.  A clean
# before/after run changed only six replay hashes; every output hash, model
# call count, terminal state, trigger kind, room view, and scenario predicate
# remained byte-identical.  This is mechanism/replay evidence, not a
# human-likeness claim.
# ``.29`` installs event-sourced Biographical Context and Life Arcs, including
# contextual NPC lifecycle and reducer bundle .41. The fixed conversation
# outputs remain fake-model evidence; changed replay/manifests are expected
# because the authority grammar and bootstrap projection gained real fields.
# ``.33`` installs reducer bundle .44. It repairs the replay-derived
# contextual-life work index during .43 migration; the index is deliberately
# absent from the semantic payload, so all scenario predicates and visible
# output hashes remain governed by the existing assertions while the installed
# reducer identity changes every replay hash.
# ``.35`` records the split between complete Proposal audit identity and
# effect identity.  PrivateTurnState remains in immutable proposal bytes, while
# the same visible Expression mints the same TypedChange/Action identities
# regardless of that audit-only state.  Visible replies and scenario
# predicates remain unchanged.
# ``.36`` adds the per-Observation Expression reliability lifecycle.
# Open/claim is atomic with ingress and terminal completion is replay-visible;
# this changes mechanism hashes without changing the character-authored reply.
# ``.38`` installs reducer bundle .45.  It adds exact newer-Observation
# authority for superseding a stale Expression retry and model-owned
# consolidation/supersession of private impressions.  The fixed suite retains
# the same visible fake-model outputs and all explicit scenario predicates,
# while the installed reducer/authority identity changes replay manifests.
# ``.39`` records clock-correct claim identity for appraisal-owned background
# triggers and the author-excluding source-review boundary for model-authored
# life facts.  A delayed worker now claims at the current World time while the
# opened trigger retains the source appraisal's logical time; fact-bearing
# life development also fails closed when no independent reviewer is wired.
# These change event/replay identities while all 120 fixed scenario predicates
# and visible fake-model outputs still pass unchanged.
# ``.40`` records the model-owned Private Turn State -> selective Recall ->
# role-free ordered Expression contract and the independently qualified
# Inventory/V7 source-review topology.  A complete pre-bump audit kept all 120
# executable predicates and every cold replay green; the changed Context,
# Proposal and provider-audit identities are therefore intentional mechanism
# drift, not evidence of human-likeness or permission to relax a truth gate.
# ``.41`` stops treating JSON object member order as causal evidence for the
# required Private Turn State.  A side-by-side run against ``.40`` kept every
# visible output, event type, Action state, model-call count and explicit
# predicate identical across all 120 cases; only replay hashes changed because
# the model request/audit identity now records the order-independent contract.
# ``.42`` upgrades the replay reducer to ``.47`` for compact pending Fact-batch
# decision recovery.  The complete fixed suite keeps all 120 explicit
# predicates and visible fake-model outputs unchanged; its replay/audit hashes
# intentionally change because the authenticated projection schema changed.
# ``.43`` records the model-owned conversational posture and the bounded
# endpoint-attention advisory in the verified trigger/prompt contract. The
# endpoint model remains advisory-only; the baseline moves because prompt and
# proposal audit identities intentionally include the new decision coordinate.
# ``.44`` records reducer .48 and the retirement of World-Author-owned life
# directions. The fixed suite has no such transition, so this is an audit and
# projection-version baseline change rather than a changed visible scenario.
# ``.45`` separates subjective Character direction from source-reviewed
# objective biographical consequence and advances open-life proposal authority
# to `.7`; the fixed suite still has no visible life-transition branch.
# ``.46`` removes factual source-declaration bookkeeping from proactive role
# authorship and moves it to a separately audited post-authorship binder. The
# frozen scenarios retain their explicit visible behavior predicates; prompt,
# provider-subcall and proposal audit identities intentionally change.
# ``.47`` records reducer .49 and its authenticated .48 head migration after
# external-perception projections became part of the conditional World state.
# The frozen corpus does not ingest external signals, so its explicit visible
# behavior predicates remain unchanged; projection and replay identities move
# because the reducer bundle is intentionally versioned rather than silently
# changing the .48 state-hash protocol.
# ``.48`` binds public-information authority to the exact domestic source
# registry under reducer .50. A differential run across all 17 scenario
# families kept visible output, event types, Action states, model-call counts,
# room views and explicit predicates unchanged; only authenticated replay
# hashes move with the reducer identity.
# ``.49`` removes the synchronous post-authorship proactive claim binder.
# Factual permission metadata now travels in the role's original structured
# decision and still crosses local closure plus independent truth review. The
# fixed suite retains its explicit behavior predicates; prompt and provider
# audit identities intentionally change.
# ``.50`` gives proactive authors the same compact, source-alias hard-boundary
# manifest already used by inbound expression and expands only those aliases
# before local closure. The manifest selects no behavior; frozen visible
# predicates remain unchanged while prompt/audit hashes intentionally move.
# ``.51`` adds source-bound NPC identity/state projections and composes the
# model-owned NPC ecology behind Life Ecology. The frozen corpus contains no
# NPC ecology wake, so its visible predicates and provider-call counts remain
# unchanged; authenticated projection identities move with reducer .51.
# ``.52`` cuts the seeded world-outcome fixture over to one CharacterInterior
# world-stimulus author.  Appraisal and optional immediate Affect now share one
# source-bound role result, so the old independent Affect trigger and third
# background model call are deliberately absent.
# ``.53`` keeps those observable predicates unchanged while making the
# structured CharacterInterior wire contract explicit and accepting only
# provider-shaped legacy envelopes whose refs/payload were authored by the
# model.  The fixed fixture consequently gets new request/audit identities;
# no semantic decision, event family, or action state is silently rewritten.
# ``.54`` records the first complete deterministic run after the subsequent
# unified-interior handoff/recovery changes were present together.  The old
# .53 hash was stale (the per-case verification predicates and replay checks
# still pass, but the aggregate request/room/replay manifest moved), so this
# is an explicit audited rebaseline rather than weakening the drift guard.
# ``.64`` binds StructuredCharacterRole provider calls to the exact emitted
# request identity, including temperature, tools/tool choice, and the canonical
# tool-contract identity. Scenario behavior and predicates are unchanged;
# durable ModelResult/replay hashes intentionally move with the corrected audit
# identity.
# ``.65`` composes the staging ``.64`` provider-emission identity with reducer
# .54 atomic relationship commitments and generic InteractionAct ``.2``
# projection/context contracts. Scenario behavior and predicates remain
# unchanged; durable request, reducer, snapshot and replay identities
# intentionally move together on the migrated staging baseline.
# ``.66`` adds the cursor-pinned relationship-stage and InteractionAct identity
# preflight to the same role wire. The frozen suite emits neither typed choice,
# so its behavioral predicates remain unchanged; the provider request and
# durable audit identities intentionally move with the corrected hard-boundary
# instructions.
# ``.67`` binds the canonical relationship commitment transition graph into
# the installed relationship policy digest. Scenario choices and predicates
# remain unchanged; policy-bearing Context and replay identities intentionally
# move with the corrected hard-boundary authority.
# ``.68`` records reducer .55, which makes an effect-free relationship
# commitment terminal advisory authoritative only for the exact installed
# compiler reason and only when the pinned current-state transition is truly
# unavailable. The frozen suite emits no such advisory; its predicates remain
# unchanged while reducer, snapshot, and replay identities move together.
# ``.69`` composes reducer .56 exact failed-main physical-provider audit
# preservation with the one-request ``reply_only`` strict role schema.  The
# complete fixed corpus keeps every existing per-case predicate enabled while
# request, reducer, snapshot, and replay identities move together.
# ``.70`` records the completed compact one-request role transport, durable
# Recall control-transfer checkpoint/audit recovery, and evidence-bound early
# retry authority.  The compact branch still preserves the existing role,
# source-review, acceptance, Action, and receipt boundaries; the frozen suite
# keeps every existing per-case predicate enabled while request, audit,
# scheduler, snapshot, and replay identities intentionally move together.
# ``.77`` records the day's accumulated production repairs as one executable
# baseline: declared_display as a world-side grant that hitchs only after the
# reply lands, compact full_turn specimens that expose the key, JSON-wire
# transport repair and pinned-source short-id restore, media-selection occasion
# as a timing gate, process-health vocabulary, post-redaction derived snapshot
# keys, a second activity consider on the wake that commits a plan, visual
# starvation fill that no longer excludes the just-missed settlement, and the
# attraction catalog putting closeup ahead of context so explicit is not framed
# wider than suggestive. Per-case predicates remain enforced; the aggregate
# prompt/policy identities intentionally move.
# ``.78`` restores visible world-truth: her own last line and delivered photos
# in the conversation slice, named QQ faces, impression release, expired
# readings that expire, waiting_for without a timer, factual wake copy, a
# 30-minute media conversation window, shareable-now inventory, a wake that
# survives one failed activity cell, family NPC registration, and the same
# local-07:00 overnight mute on spontaneous contact that open hopes already
# had. Per-case predicates remain enforced; aggregate identities move.
# ``.79`` stops life-outcome prose from completing a user-channel send: World
# Author outcomes carry ``user_channel_completion=none``, Open World is told
# the same Action-ledger boundary, and a compensating
# LifeContentUserChannelAuthorityLimited event can omit forged lived prose
# from present materials without rewriting history. The same bump also carries
# the proactive slim hitch (us_deltas / we_are / keep_impression / noticed /
# declared_display on the contact tool) and the live-conversation media
# occasion that offers an already-open candidate when he spoke recently
# relative to now. Per-case predicates remain enforced; World Author, Open
# World, and proactive tool identities move.
# ``.80`` closes the declared-due clock wake set by construction (projection
# extractors + three computed peeks; Silence stays non-waking), installs the
# shareable-photos / living-state inventory paths, DeepSeek peak/off-peak CNY
# pricing with production/debug spend accounts, and PrivateImpression user-
# channel authority limits. Per-case predicates remain enforced; aggregate
# prompt/policy identities intentionally move.
# ``.82`` composes reply_only media-intent channel coverage (photo /
# media_request on now sends), post-silent chain release after settlement, and
# health shadow-due clearing only when ambient/post-silent are honestly closed.
# Per-case predicates remain enforced; aggregate prompt / transport identities
# intentionally move.
# ``.83`` splits moments_i_can_share into two non-substitutable world facts:
# on-hand shareable inventory (photo_in_hand / available_count) versus whether
# she can photograph a new present-moment frame (now.photographable). The old
# copy bound "send now" to "cannot photograph now", which starved delivery of
# already-open candidates. Per-case predicates remain enforced; only the
# present-prompt instruction identity moves.
# ``.84`` composes five production lines that share capsule/resolver identity:
# S18 long-silence/situation-independent outreach with a shared daily cap,
# first-visible response-expectation wake, four-axis stranger→friend ladder
# at 500/1800, epoch-1 archive Fact recall plus stable-before-episodic
# ranking and compact relevant_facts, and character voice that unbinds
# joking from a relationship-stage gate. Per-case predicates remain
# enforced; prompt, policy, recall, and replay identities move together.
# ``.85`` compacts provider-facing appraisals into a row table in
# Background lane provider views now use explicit ``BackgroundContextProfile``
# slices; canonical snapshots/capsules unchanged. Structured-role request
# envelopes shrink; offline replay hashes update accordingly.
# 2026-08-20: rebaselined to .87 after proactive_contact citeable_sources
# are capped at eight before the model sees them (attention boundary aligned
# with attended_source_refs). Complete fake suite hash:
# 6ab348fe9ea2a49aead4807b0df79440ed426dc88bd0fc30e5e8f360f3bf5204
# 9ac9e0b3429c19ff3cf29ee39a01af95b163bec617c3e873714df694ede5779c
FROZEN_OFFLINE_SUITE_BASELINE_VERSION = "world-v2-offline-mechanism-baseline.102"

# Filled only after the complete, fixed fake suite has been run. A change to
# this value requires the corresponding baseline-version rationale; it must
# not be rewritten merely to silence a scenario failure.
# 2026-08-06: rebaselined to .52 after the suite's two cross-process
# nondeterminism sources were removed: (1) the expression-episode claim owner
# is now pinned by WorldV2TurnApplicationConfig.expression_episode_owner, and
# (2) the recall-trace HMAC authority key is now pinned by
# install_trace_authority_key() instead of a fresh secrets.token_bytes per
# process. The frozen manifest hash is byte-identical across independent
# processes; this hash was verified twice cross-process.
# 2026-08-07: rebaselined while the frozen fixture remained on the historical
# declared-claims-only source-review lane and the author contract was hardened:
# the reviewer/repair lanes no longer alter
# candidates, the author prompt gained the closed-scope "declare before you
# assert" hard clause and beats-last serialization, and Inner Life Snapshot
# material limits were trimmed. All drift is expected prompt/material input
# change; the deterministic boundary itself is unchanged.
# 2026-08-07 2nd: appraisal output length discipline (brief_rationale /
# behavior_tendency / display_strategy <= 120 chars, meanings <= 2 at <= 64
# chars) shifts the frozen fake-suite prompt; deterministic boundary unchanged.
# 2026-08-07 3rd: fabricated-ref stripping (expression + proposal layers) and
# trigger observation-event binding change accepted-proposal evidence paths;
# the frozen fake-suite manifest shifts accordingly. Deterministic boundary
# unchanged (strip only drops claims that would have failed closed).
# 2026-08-08: compact reply shape (response_text without beats) accepted in
# the stream partition; explicit authored field requirements relaxed to
# defaults (timing/confidence/cadence); compact-shape prompt guidance rolled
# back (model self-selection was unreliable); repair temperature lowered to
# 0.2 and yield/now anti-pattern added to the author contract. Fake-suite
# prompt/partition input shifts; deterministic boundary unchanged.
# 2026-08-08 2nd: the CharacterInterior structured-role contract now states
# the nested generic decision and typed-proposal shapes explicitly.  The
# boundary accepts only a structural legacy-envelope normalization when the
# model already supplied the source refs and complete payload; it never
# fabricates summary, refs, facts, motive, timing, or silence.  The resulting
# fixture request/audit identities move while exported event families,
# visible outputs, action states, and model-call counts remain unchanged.
# 2026-08-09: complete isolated rerun after the unified-interior handoff and
# recovery changes produced the stable manifest below.  Every frozen case
# passed its explicit event/action/replay predicates; only the aggregate
# manifest changed from the stale .53 value.
# 2026-08-09 2nd: world-stimulus appraisal now requires the versioned
# character_role_world_stimulus_appraisal_v1 function.  The fixed scenario
# model advertises and receives that transport; visible predicates remain
# unchanged, but request/audit rows (and therefore the aggregate manifest)
# move.  This is an explicit protocol rebaseline, not a relaxed assertion.
# 2026-08-09 3rd: the expression contract now states that first-person life
# facts require matching pinned world_claims.  The fixed suite's visible
# predicates remain unchanged, while its prompt/audit material moves.  Keep
# the drift guard explicit rather than weakening it for this intentional
# source-boundary change.
# 2026-08-09 4th: the appraisal contract now explicitly keeps trust in the
# relationship signal rather than the affect dimensions.  The fixed suite's
# visible predicates remain unchanged while its prompt/audit material moves;
# the DeepSeek strict-schema projection is transport-only and uses the same
# canonical semantics. Rebaseline the aggregate hash instead of weakening
# the drift guard.
# 2026-08-09 5th: durable CharacterInterior author identity is carried through
# the Deliberation audit boundary.  Fixed scenario predicates remain unchanged,
# but the complete executable manifest is rebaselined to the resulting hash.
# 2026-08-09 6th: inbound, expression-reconsideration, and memory opportunities
# now use the canonical source→opportunity identity.  These are lineage-only
# changes: the frozen event/action/replay predicates remain unchanged, while
# durable audit rows (and therefore the aggregate manifest) move again.
# 2026-08-10: the NPC world-impact fixture now replays the focused actor capsule
# and neutral shared-history projection.  The complete before/after row audit
# changed only that fixture's replay hash; its output, events, actions, trigger
# kinds, model-call counts, restart evidence, and verification predicates are
# byte-identical.  Keep the aggregate drift guard and bind the audited replay.
# 2026-08-11: reducer .53 adds the default-excluded role-owned media-request
# coordinate plus its durable TriggerProcess authority.  The final bridge also
# requires a correlated durable media terminal before completing that trigger.
# The frozen suite has no media deployment or request, so every visible/event/
# action predicate is unchanged; the authenticated reducer identity and
# versioned contract material intentionally move the aggregate replay manifest.
# 2026-08-11 2nd: expression media intent gains a dedicated source-authority
# coordinate. PrivateTurnState attention remains audit-only; only explicit
# media_source_refs that are also immutable proposal evidence may compile a
# candidate. The world-stimulus contract also explains that a role-authored
# reply_reconsideration Thread is an inner intention, not a scheduled message.
# Frozen visible outputs, event/action predicates and per-case replay checks
# remain unchanged; request/audit identities intentionally move.
# 2026-08-11 3rd: the provider-only strict timing branches now require the
# canonical non-null world_claims array instead of admitting ``null`` and then
# paying for a same-role correction. Canonical defaults, Character decisions,
# all 120 visible/event/action predicates, and per-case replay checks remain
# unchanged; only strict tool/request audit identities move.
# 2026-08-11 4th: StructuredCharacterRole request identity now uses the exact
# provider-emission contract (temperature + rendered tools/tool choice +
# versioned tool identity), and the guarded loopback header is verified against
# that same durable hash. All scenario predicates remain unchanged; only
# request/audit-derived replay identities move.
# 2026-08-11 5th: reducer .54 installs atomic relationship commitments and the
# generic InteractionAct projection. CharacterInterior advertises the optional
# typed wires and carries committed InteractionAct heads in snapshot .7. The
# frozen suite produces neither effect, and all per-case visible/event/action/
# replay predicates remain enforced; prompt, reducer and snapshot identities
# intentionally move the aggregate manifest.
# 2026-08-11 6th: InteractionAct .2 replaces the offer/response lifecycle with
# generic declare/revise operations and source-attributed participant status
# marks. The frozen suite still emits no InteractionAct, so its per-case
# visible/event/action/replay predicates remain unchanged; the role wire and
# snapshot contract identities intentionally move the aggregate manifest.
# ``.67`` composes that migrated baseline with the complete relationship
# transition-policy identity. Two independent complete frozen-suite processes
# produced the same aggregate manifest before the new hash was installed.
# ``.68`` composes the exact relationship-commitment terminal authority with
# reducer .55. Two independent complete frozen-suite processes must produce
# the same aggregate manifest before the new hash is installed.
# ``.69`` composes the single physical role-request path and reducer .56's
# durable exact physical-terminal binding. Two independent complete 120-case
# processes must produce the same aggregate manifest before installation.
# ``.70`` composes the compact single-request role transport with durable
# Recall control-transfer recovery and the evidence-bound 30-second retry
# authority. Two independent complete 120-case processes must produce the
# same aggregate manifest before installation.
# ``.71`` composes H17-H21: one-shot corrective policy, slim mood/wait/media
# fields, deterministic declared-claim source closure, and the ambient
# proactive expiry switch. Per-case predicates remain enforced; the aggregate
# prompt/snapshot identities intentionally move.
# ``.72`` unfreezes the two things the production ledger showed were stuck: the
# slim object now carries her own us_deltas (relationship movement was pinned
# to zero on the only path production uses) and her own matters_bp (every
# reading was pinned to 5000, below the reflection threshold, so nothing ever
# came back to her). Prompt wording drops the stage discouragement and the
# persona stops softening conflict. Per-case predicates remain enforced; the
# aggregate prompt/appraisal identities intentionally move. Two independent
# complete 120-case processes produced this hash before installation.
# ``.73`` gives the world back its authors. The weighted tables that answered
# "nothing happened" for the World Author on 80% of wakes and for NPCs on every
# wake with a reviewed catalog are gone, so a life wake reaches a model that can
# also legitimately say no_op. The commitment protocol installs ambiguous and
# lover as stages she declares in sent words and that thresholds may never
# derive or demote, an unreadable appraisal wire keeps the affect she named,
# reply_only prose is trimmed and closes in Chinese, and the paid impression
# lane finally has an anchor. Per-case predicates remain enforced; the aggregate
# prompt/policy identities intentionally move. Two independent complete 120-case
# processes produced this hash before installation.
# ``.74`` puts the turn in her language and shows her what her own choices kept.
# The slim contract is Chinese prose around English JSON identifiers, and the
# snapshot carries a derived retention view of the feelings, impressions and
# weights that survived. Per-case predicates remain enforced; the aggregate

# output, event types, terminal Actions, model counts, room view and all
# scenario predicates are unchanged. Request identity changes propagate to
# model-result, acceptance and expression audit identities. Historical stored
# events are not rewritten. See docs/audits/living-continuity-2026-09-07.md.
# 2026-09-08: .94 follows equivalent world-stimulus schema deduplication.
# All 120 business manifests are unchanged; only npc_world_impact.01 replay
# identity changes, starting at its recorded request hash. Restoring only the
# old schema function restores every old manifest field. See the independent
# comparison in docs/audits/longitudinal-real-testing-2026-09-08.md. This does
# not qualify real-model behavior or rewrite historical ledger events.
# 2026-09-08: .95 separates habitual windows and future participants from
# current-life authority (snapshot compiler .18, Situation policy .16.1).
# All 120 complete run exports differ from .94 only in replay_hash. Fixed
# predicates, visible output, event types, model counts, Actions and room
# projections remain unchanged. See context-factual-authority-2026-09-08.md
# for the preserved comparison and separate real-model counterexample.
# 2026-09-08: .96 preserves authored compact claims, retires both source
# stripping paths and aligns source obligations with the actual slim examples.
# The existing novel-origin review also includes its formerly omitted premise.
# Both candidate runs preserve all 17 non-replay fields across 120 scenarios;
# the final after-wire candidate changes only replay identities from .95.
# See adaptive-companionship-2026-09-08.md and its preserved comparisons.
# 2026-09-08: .97 records current/completed activity source views, explicit
# chat life intent and the existing temporal-premise review clarification.
# Three complete clean-code exports (including the final scheduler/recovery
# fixes) preserve all 17 non-replay fields in all 120 ordered cases from .96.
# Only replay identity changes; no scenario predicate or byte limit moves.
# See adaptive-companionship-2026-09-08.md and baseline-life-links-clock.
# 2026-09-08: .99 records expression-hard-boundaries.present.2, which retains
# the exact, already-derived biography alias/field/value catalog in the model
# input. The complete 120-case candidate differs from .98 only in replay_hash;
# every other run field and predicate is unchanged. Source authority, model
# call counts and output/room hashes do not change. See the independently
# compared baseline-biography-readable candidate and audit report.
# 2026-09-08: .100 offers the source-bound world-life-intent capability in the
# existing world stimulus turn. All 120 cases retain every non-replay field;
# only npc_world_impact.01's replay hash changes. Its first changed event is
# the role ModelResultRecorded after the new capability and contract prose.
# A separate, single-case causal control restoring only those two inputs
# reproduces every old manifest field, including the .99 replay hash. No
# case predicate, output, model-call budget or timing bound changes. See
# world-life-intent-baseline-comparison.json and ADR-0019's implementation audit.
# 2026-09-08: .101 persists the complete original inbound output in decision .2.
# The 120-case comparison changes only replay_hash; output, calls, event types,
# action terminal states and every predicate remain identical. A diagnostic
# control restoring only the original .1 Faculty producer reproduces the entire
# .100 manifest. The first changed leaf is the recorded Interior decision hash,
# followed by derived audit/Acceptance identities, not a new character choice.
# See living-continuity-integration-2026-09-08.md and the 11909fb5 causal artifacts.
# 2026-09-13: .102 records the already-drifted DeepSeek integration baseline.
# Complete exports at 4d427fb8, b003fda4, and a4359ba3 are identical, including
# every frozen predicate. Against the hash-verified .101 export, only all 120
# replay_hash fields differ; all 17 other case fields remain identical. The
# first-case ledger comparison starts at ModelResultRecorded's emitted-request
# and derived audit identities, with the original response hash unchanged.
# No assertion, case, output or cost limit is weakened. This records offline
# mechanism identity, not model semantics or release qualification. Evidence:
