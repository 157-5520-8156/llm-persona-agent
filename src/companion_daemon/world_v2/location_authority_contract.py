"""Single routing contract for the `.16.0` LocationAuthority event family.

DORMANT — no producer: no production ledger holds a committed ``V2Location*``
event and no runtime constructs these payloads. Plan location coordinates do
not prove current presence; Situation reports missing Location authority as
unavailable. Before wiring a producer,
read the Producer-First Authority rule in CONTEXT.md and record the
activation verdict in ``configs/mechanism_closure.yaml``
(``v16-situation-constituents``).
