"""Deterministic, model-safe view of one pending declared response expectation.

When she speaks, the expression contract may freeze a model-declared
``ResponseExpectationAuthority`` ("I hope they come back and tell me how it
went").  Until now that authority only drove behaviour (the response-gap
follow-up lane).  This module gives the feeling lanes the same committed
fact: being left waiting after asking for comfort and being left waiting
after an idle remark are different experiences, and the appraisal model can
only weigh that difference if it knows what she hoped for.

Everything here is a pure read over one pinned projection.  The exported
view carries only semantic values (hoped response, coarse pressure and
importance, how long she has been waiting) and never IDs, hashes or
authority references; the advisory helper binds the committed sources in
the ordinary Inner-Advisory envelope instead.
